BUG: Double pipe || causes a single token "||" 
            // no error cause we dont handle OR and AND
BUG: Segfault AST append_arguments
            // fixed wrong mem allocation
Bug: Should a missing argument after | or redirection cause an error?
    e.g. "echo "test" |"
Bug: use current->next; each token after > has only one character of the whole string
            //fixed (added a rule to stop the lexing when a redirection operator is inside the input string)
Bug:
